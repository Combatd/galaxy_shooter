# Space Shooter Pro: A Unity Beginner's Guide

## Introduction
Space Shooter Pro is a classic 2D arcade-style game where players control a spaceship, dodge enemies, collect power-ups, and defeat waves of enemies. This project is designed to introduce beginners to fundamental Unity concepts in an engaging and practical way.

## Learning Goals
* Master Unity's interface and basic navigation

* Understand GameObjects, Components, and the Unity component system

* Learn C# scripting fundamentals for game development

* Implement player movement and controls

* Create enemy behavior and spawn systems

* Design power-ups and collectible mechanics

* Add visual and audio effects to enhance game feel

* Build a simple UI system for score and lives

## Core Game Mechanics
* **Player Control**: Move your spaceship with WASD or arrow keys and shoot with the spacebar

* **Enemy Waves**: Defeat increasingly difficult waves of enemy ships

* **Power-ups**: Collect items that enhance your weapons, speed, or shields

* **Lives System**: Manage your limited lives to survive as long as possible

* **Score System**: Earn points by destroying enemies and achieving objectives

## Key Unity Concepts Covered
* **Prefabs**: Reusable game objects like enemies and projectiles

* **Physics**: Collision detection between ships, projectiles, and power-ups

* **Animation**: Simple animations for explosions and effects

* **Particle Systems**: Visual effects for engines, explosions, and weapons

* **Audio**: Sound effects and background music implementation

* **UI Elements**: Score display, lives counter, and game over screen

## Project Structure
* **Scripts**: C# code controlling game behavior

* **Prefabs**: Reusable game objects

* **Scenes**: Different game states (main menu, gameplay, etc.)

* **Assets**: Sprites, audio files, and other resources

## Getting Started
1. Open the project in Unity

2. Explore the main scene to understand how objects are organized

3. Review the Player script to see how input and movement work

4. Run the game and experiment with the controls

5. Make small modifications to customize the experience
